Chatroom between two devices (client/server) with AES encryption. 

The program needs some modification on your part to work for your case. Please change the following: encryption key, Message length and IPs (I'm using 127.0.0.1 as a localhost).

For everything to work, download all the files on a directory, run the bash file "link.sh" using the following command on your terminal (bash link.sh). Finally run ./server first and then ./client. 

This project was made for fun, meaning nothing is optimized or scalable. If you're interested in making the program better, please don't hesitate to send me a pull request or an email (sailjlad@gmail.com), I'll be glad to take a look.
